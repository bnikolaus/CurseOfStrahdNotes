gate with headless statues.
![Gate](images/GatesofBarovia.jpg)
- Errebus gets us all inspiration for putting to rest a man who was hanging in a tree, probably 
one of the dead guys we have be looking for.
- Nicky Climbs the dead tree and sees a light  which they follow to big scary house
- Outside the light up house the Party agree's to take a look at the basement to ensure for a good 
nights rest.
- Once inside everyone is given a feast, except Nikkey does drugs upstairs and cannot sleep due to 
paranoia.
- After arguing over is the house safe, finally the decide to sleep.
- They wake to chills and appear to be walled in the House by bricks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Nikkey still high, can't sleep and eventually sees a spectral image of a servant and trys to wake 
everyone up. 
- Nilneak just wants to sleep even after everyone goes downstairs after hearing more noises downstairs
- A few of us go Downstairs after 30 minutes of trying to figure out how darkvision works in Roll20 
and we find a new party member a new Cleric Erasmus who actually probably likes elf's unlike some people
- After another 30 minutes  of trying to figure out whats going on, Nikkey daringly decides to open a door, 
which Seabiscuit decided was better to open using a mage hand but Nikkey slapped that mage hand away.
- The food everyone ate, was actually old and rotting and people are now getting poisened
- Unprovoked Nilneak just randomly decides to start vandalizing Rose and Thorns house with Eldritch Blasts
and gets attacked by glass eyed dog. Nilneak is clearly not an animal lover and has never heard of arson.
- After what seems like forever they go upstairs and nn a Dare, Nikkey sprung a suit of Trap of Magical Armor, 
Skylarc wrestled with the Magical Armor and threw it off the Balcony, then Nikkey Jumped off a 30 story 
Balcony, which he rolled a crit to vanquish the armor and save the day 
- As they searched more rooms found a Tigersking Rug/cloak and used it to creatively ensare a Broom with a crit, and immediatly 
after Erebus rolled a crit and smashed it to peices... Thats fucking Teamwork.
- He also found a treasure chest full of some documents, magical scrolls, and procurred a poison dart from
a trap. Poison was fatally strong enought kill someone.
- Strahds Letter - Nikkey examined Strahds letter and begain forging Documents from Strahds handwritting 
```
To whomever reads this letter, 

Please extend the finest hospitality Barovia has to offer to the companions who 
have this letter. Your lord expect you will treat them with the highest regard and 
equip them with whatever they so desire for which I will reimburse at twice the rate.

The penalty for not honoring my wishes and accomodating these traveler's will be 
dealt with extreme prudence.

Your dread lord and master,
Strahd von Zarovich
