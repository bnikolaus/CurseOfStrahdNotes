The only thing sharper than Nikkey Dunda's his sword is perhaps is mouth. This smooth talking trickster has spent the last few years roaming the Sword Coast making a good living fleecing and swindling magical items for powerful Wizards and Warlocks. Due to his success, Nikkey finds himself in a bit of a dark time lost strange feelings. Not knowing how to handle these feelings he has chosen to mask them with druugs. He doesn't quite feel himself and it is as if something or someone inside him is steering him. He feels as if he is loosing control.  

Recently he has decided to turn a new page in his life and has chosen to surround himself with more agreeable people in an attempt to get away from everything. The only time Nikkey can function is under the influence of drugs and he will often will dissappear for short periods of time to get his fix and get back under control.

He has no family but has a soft spot for children and people in extreme poverty and actually gives just as much as he takes.

He is likely to take any quest just to get escape his addiction and whatever dark thoughts are poisening his mind.

Eventually he is going to succumb to the darkness and become a warlock. This transition is the result of accidentally viewing the pages a tome of shadows he had been hired to aquire for a powerful Warlock. The Warlock told him to not view the tome under any circumstances and that small peak has unknowingly unleashed a dark diety bound to this book inside Nikkey. This diety is slowly poisening him with to the breaking point to get him to do his bidding.
