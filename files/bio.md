The only thing sharper than Nikkey Dunda's sword is his mouth. This smooth talking trickster has won and lost a fortune running confidence games all up and down the Sword Coast. He rides a wave of constant highs and lows and loves the ride. He is constantly pushing the limit to his schemes which has served as gateway to other problems and addictions. The only time Nikkey can function straight anymore. Years of operating in this thrillseeking manner has made it so he cannot function straight. He will often will dissappear for short periods of time to get his fix and get back under control. It would seem as if the biggest deception he is running is convincing himself that he doesn't have a problem.

Times have been a little tough and after a few unsavory acts he has chosed to join up with some reputable people in an attempt to escape his past.
