Nikkey Dunda is an arrogant but well established procurer of items in some of the darker circles of the world. The only thing sharper than his sword is his mouth. After a few succesful jobs and a lot of coin he finds himself in a bit of a dark patch perhaps perhaps trying to bury some of his past transgressions in addictions of some of the finer substances but it is as if something inside him is steering him and he feels as if he is loosing control.  

Recently he has decided to turn a new page in his life and has chosen to surround himself with more agreeable people in an attempt to get away from the darkness that is crawling out of him which only seems to go away under the influence. He will often will dissappear for short periods of time to get his fix and get back under control.

He has no family but has a soft spot for children and people in extreme poverty. 

He is likely to take any quest just to get escape his addiction and whatever dark thoughts are clouding his mind.

Eventually he is going to succumb to the darkness and become a warlock. This transition is the result of accidentally viewing the pages a tome of shadows he had been hired to aquire for a powerful Warlock. The Warlock told him to not view the tome under any circumstances and that small peak has unknowingly unleashed a dark diety bound to this book inside Nikkey. This diety is slowly poisening him with to the breaking point to get him to do his bidding.
